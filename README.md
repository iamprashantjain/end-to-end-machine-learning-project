# end-to-end-machine-learning-project


- 1. Webscraped Laptop data from smartprix for analysis & model building using Python & JavaScript
- 2. Extensive Data Cleaning required since columns were not in same order & multiple blockers, So ita a good learning experience
- 3. EDA: Performed extensive eda to understand how columns are related to each other, there was no scope of feature engineering since it was all done at the time of data cleaning
  4. Pre- processing: Applied pre processing before model building like Encoding, Scaling, Splitting data into Train & Test
  5. Applied basic regression models with accuracy of 80%.
  6. There is a lot of scope in it... like applying Feature Selection since multiple columns have no relation with Price except storeage, ram & specscore
  7. Apply other advanced models, apply transformation, perform regression analysis, perform regression assumptions etc
